Data Visualization Results
==========================

- Figure 1: 2008 Financial Crisis Trend & Peak
This figure displays the U.S. unemployment rate from January 2006 to December 2009, capturing the gradual rise during the 2008 financial crisis. The unemployment rate increased steadily from around 4.5% in early 2007 to a peak of 10.0% in October 2009. The plot clearly shows the delayed impact of the crisis on the labor market and the persistence of high unemployment into the recovery phase.

- Figure 2: COVID-19 Unemployment Rate Trend & Peak
This visualization captures the dramatic surge in unemployment during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate spiked sharply from around 3.5% to 14.8% in April 2020—the highest in modern U.S. history—before rapidly declining over the following months. This sharp peak and quick recovery contrast with the slower, more prolonged trend observed in the 2008 crisis.

- Figure 3: Unemployment Rate (Last 10 Years)
Spanning 2015 to 2025, this chart contextualizes the COVID-19 spike within a broader 10-year window. It highlights a generally declining trend until early 2020, a sharp disruption due to the pandemic, followed by a relatively swift recovery. Post-2022, the unemployment rate stabilizes around 3.5%–4.5%.

- Figure 4: Unemployment Rate Over Time (1948–2024)
This long-term historical graph provides a comprehensive view of unemployment cycles in the U.S. since 1948. It visualizes several recessions and economic downturns, with significant peaks in the early 1980s, 2008–2009, and the sharp spike in 2020. The COVID-19 spike stands out due to its magnitude and abruptness, while earlier peaks reflect slower economic contractions.

- Figure 5: Average Unemployment Rate by Decade
This bar chart summarizes the average unemployment rate by decade. The highest average appears in the 1980s (~7.3%), reflecting multiple recessions. The 2020s show a relatively moderate average so far (~4.9%), despite the dramatic spike in 2020, indicating strong post-pandemic recovery in the labor market.

- Figure 6: Early 1980s Recession Trend
Covering 1973 to 1993, this figure focuses on the unemployment dynamics surrounding the early 1980s recession. Unemployment peaked twice—once in 1975 (~9%) and again in 1982 (~10.8%). These back-to-back recessions contributed to a prolonged period of elevated unemployment, visible in the sustained high rates throughout the decade.

- Figure 7: Early 1980s Recession Peak (1980–1982)
This zoomed-in view emphasizes the lead-up to the 1982 peak, showing a slow, steady climb in unemployment beginning in 1980. The rate reached 10.8% in November 1982, highlighting the severity of the early 1980s economic downturn, caused in part by tight monetary policy to combat inflation.


Business Interpretation of Findings
===================================

- The unemployment rate follows a cyclical pattern, closely tied to periods of economic expansion and contraction.

- Major spikes occurred during:
  - The early 1980s recession: peaked at 10.8% in late 1982, with an average of 8.6% from 1980–1982.
  - The 2008 financial crisis: peaked at 10.0% in October 2009.
  - The COVID-19 pandemic: saw a record high of 14.8% in April 2020.

- The 1990s emerged as the most stable decade, with an average unemployment rate of 5.76% and the lowest standard deviation (1.05), reflecting strong and consistent growth.

- Despite short-term disruptions, the overall long-term trend shows a gradual decline in unemployment and greater labor market resilience.

Together, these findings highlight how external economic shocks impact employment and why understanding unemployment cycles is essential—not just for historical context, but for informing smart workforce planning, risk assessment, and business strategy moving forward.
